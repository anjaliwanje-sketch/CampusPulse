# CampusPulse — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 2.0  
**Status:** Development Specification — Workshop Intervention Expansion  
**Product:** AI-Powered Student Placement Readiness & Intervention Platform

## 01. Product Overview

CampusPulse is an AI-powered placement management and readiness platform
for students, placement officers, colleges, and recruiters.

Unlike a traditional placement portal that mainly manages applications
and drives, CampusPulse continuously measures **student readiness for a
specific company**, identifies skill gaps and recruitment-stage risks,
recommends interventions, and reassesses progress.

### Core loop

`Assess → Analyze → Identify Gaps → Recommend Intervention → Practice/Workshop → Reassess → Improve Readiness`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 02. Problem Statement

Traditional college placement systems mainly track students,
eligibility, applications, drives and selections. They generally do not
answer:

-   Which student is ready for a specific company?
-   Which recruitment stage is the student likely to struggle with?
-   What skills are missing?
-   Why is the student not ready?
-   Which students require immediate intervention?
-   What intervention should be conducted?
-   Did the intervention improve readiness?

CampusPulse addresses this gap by combining student profiles, academic
records, skills, certifications, projects, resumes, company
requirements, assessments, interviews and historical performance into an
actionable readiness system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Product Proposition

> **CampusPulse continuously measures a student's readiness for specific
> company placement drives, identifies the exact skill and
> recruitment-stage gaps that may prevent selection, and recommends
> targeted interventions before the placement process begins.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 37. College-Led Workshop Intervention System

CampusPulse now includes a complete **College Workshop Intervention** module.
Workshops are not only generic learning events; they are targeted interventions
created from measured student skill gaps and linked to upcoming placement
drives.

### Core use case

Example:

```text
Placement Officer opens Skill Gap Analytics
                ↓
System detects:
50 students → DSA below required level
37 students → C++ below required level
                ↓
Officer creates:
"DSA + C++ Placement Bootcamp"
                ↓
Target cohort = identified students
                ↓
Students receive workshop access
                ↓
Students attend scheduled sessions
                ↓
Pre-workshop assessment
                ↓
College-led workshop
                ↓
Post-workshop assessment
                ↓
Skill scores + readiness recalculated
                ↓
Officer sees improvement / remaining gaps
                ↓
Students needing more help are assigned another intervention
```

### Workshop objectives

The module must allow the college to:

- detect common skill deficiencies across a student population;
- create a workshop around one or more missing/weak skills;
- target students automatically from skill-gap analytics;
- manually add/remove students where authorized;
- publish the workshop to selected students;
- allow eligible students to view and enroll;
- track registration and attendance;
- conduct pre-workshop and post-workshop assessments;
- compare skill scores before and after intervention;
- recalculate company-specific readiness;
- identify students who remain at risk;
- measure workshop effectiveness at cohort and student level.

### Workshop types

Supported intervention types:

- DSA / Coding
- C++
- Java / Python
- SQL / DBMS
- Aptitude
- Communication
- Technical Interview
- HR / Behavioral Interview
- Resume / Profile Building
- Company-specific Bootcamp
- Custom college workshop

### Workshop ownership

Workshops are created and managed by authorized college users:

- Placement Officer
- College Admin

Optional future support may include instructor accounts, but instructor
management is not required for the MVP.

### Workshop targeting

A workshop can target students using:

- Skill
- Skill score threshold
- Skill-gap priority
- Company drive
- Branch
- Semester
- CGPA
- Readiness range
- Risk level
- Manual student selection

Example targeting rule:

```text
Target Skill: Data Structures
Current Score: < 60
Priority: High/Critical
Target Drive: Company X
Eligible Branches: CSE, IT, ECE
```

The system should show the projected cohort size before publishing.

### Workshop lifecycle

### Student workshop experience

Students should see:

- workshop title;
- why they were selected;
- target skill;
- linked company/drive, when applicable;
- instructor;
- date/time;
- duration;
- delivery mode;
- venue or meeting link;
- available seats;
- registration status;
- attendance status;
- pre-assessment status;
- post-assessment status;
- improvement score;
- updated readiness;
- next recommended action.

Example:

```text
DSA + C++ Placement Bootcamp

You have been invited because:
DSA Score: 54 / 100
Required for selected drive: 75 / 100

Date: 18 Oct
Duration: 2 hours
Mode: College Classroom
Seats: 50

[ Register ]
```

### Workshop access rules

- Only authenticated eligible students can access the registration action.
- A student cannot register twice for the same workshop.
- Capacity limits must be enforced.
- If enabled, the college may auto-enroll the target cohort.
- A placement officer may override eligibility.
- Students can see workshops assigned to them from the dashboard.
- Workshop access must not expose another student's private performance data.

### Pre/post intervention measurement

A workshop may optionally have:

```text
Pre-assessment
    ↓
Workshop
    ↓
Post-assessment
```

For each student store:

- pre-workshop skill score;
- post-workshop skill score;
- score improvement;
- pre-workshop readiness;
- post-workshop readiness;
- attendance;
- completion;
- remaining skill gap;
- next recommendation.

Example:

```text
Student A
DSA Before: 54
DSA After: 78
Improvement: +24
Readiness Before: 61%
Readiness After: 76%
Status: Gap Improved
```

### College intervention analytics

Placement officers must be able to answer:

- How many students lack DSA?
- How many lack C++?
- Which skills affect the largest number of students?
- Which upcoming drives are affected?
- How many students were assigned to a workshop?
- How many registered?
- How many attended?
- What was the average pre-workshop score?
- What was the average post-workshop score?
- How many students crossed the required threshold?
- How many students remain at risk?
- Did readiness improve after the intervention?

### Workshop effectiveness

The system should calculate, where sufficient data exists:

```text
Attendance Rate
Completion Rate
Average Skill Improvement
Average Readiness Improvement
Threshold-Cleared Count
Remaining At-Risk Count
```

These metrics are descriptive intervention analytics, not claims of causal
impact unless the college explicitly performs a suitable evaluation.

### Integration with recommendation engine

Recommendations should be able to produce:

```text
Skill Gap
   ↓
Workshop Available?
   ├── Yes → Recommend / Assign Workshop
   └── No  → Recommend Practice / Learning Resource
```

A workshop recommendation should explain:

```text
Recommended because:
- DSA is a high-priority gap
- Your score is 54
- Required score is 75
- 42 students in your cohort share this gap
- A college workshop is available before the drive
```

### Integration with placement drives

For an upcoming drive:

```text
Company Requirements
       ↓
Student Skill Gaps
       ↓
Cohort Analysis
       ↓
Intervention Workshop
       ↓
Reassessment
       ↓
Updated Drive Readiness
```

Placement officers can open a drive and see:

```text
Skill Gap             Students Affected   Workshop Needed
DSA                   50                  Yes
C++                   37                  Yes
SQL                   18                  Optional
Communication         12                  Recommended
```

### Acceptance criteria

The feature is complete when the following scenario works end-to-end:

```text
50 students have DSA score < 60
             ↓
Placement Officer sees "50 students need DSA intervention"
             ↓
Officer creates "DSA + C++ Placement Workshop"
             ↓
System identifies eligible students
             ↓
Students receive notification
             ↓
Students register / are auto-enrolled
             ↓
Attendance is recorded
             ↓
Pre/post assessments are completed
             ↓
Skill scores are updated
             ↓
Readiness is recalculated
             ↓
Officer sees how many students crossed the target threshold
```

### Product differentiator update

CampusPulse therefore closes the operational loop:

```text
Measure
   ↓
Detect
   ↓
Group
   ↓
Intervene
   ↓
Train
   ↓
Reassess
   ↓
Measure Improvement
   ↓
Prepare for Drive
```

This makes the placement platform useful not only for tracking placement
activity, but also for helping the college actively prepare students before
a company recruitment process.
